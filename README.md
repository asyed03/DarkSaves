# DarkSaves
A simple program to quickly load and save files. Made 100% in python using tkinter for the gui.

1. Set the source file, this will be the file to make copies of.
2. Set the path directory, this will be the directory in which all the save files will be stored
3. Click "save" to make a backup of the file
4. Click "load" to copy and overwrite the file as the source file
5. Click "rename" to rename files
6. Click "delete" to delete files
7. Save and load hotkeys can be set, currently there are a few common hotkeys blocked, such as WASD, Space, and BackSpace
8. Hotkeys can be "unset" by pressing any of the above mentioned invalid keys after clicking in the field
9. Any of the default settings can be changed at any time in the darksavesconfig.txt
